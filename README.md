OpenVPN & DNSmasq dispatcher script for NetworkManager


Base on internal user request, I`d to create the dispatcher script for NetworkManager 
allow run up/down script for DNSMasq when a VPN connection was started. 
In the current setup when VPN is started via NetworkManager no scripts is run.

In the case I`d like o add this script into NetworkManager package so it can be use by others SUSE users as well.
